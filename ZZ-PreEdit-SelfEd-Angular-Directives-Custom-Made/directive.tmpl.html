<div>This is the custom directive called <span style="color:red">mydirective1.</span><br>
    It shows this text which is the content from the HTML template file: <span style="color:red; font-size:30px; font-weight:bold; ">directive.tmpl.html</span><br>
    It has its own directive definition making it a unique and custom HTML element. This is because the < restrict > keyword is used.<br>See Code Block AAA
