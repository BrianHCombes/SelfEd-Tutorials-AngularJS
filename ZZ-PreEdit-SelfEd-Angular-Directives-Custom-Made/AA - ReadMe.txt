SelfEd Date: 		01/17/2017
                        01/01/2017 is the date this SelfEd was originally 
                        started.

SelfEd Title:           SelfEd-Angular-Directives-Custom-Made

SelfEd Objective:       To learn directives in depth.

SelfEd Catalyst:        Had been working on:
                        < SelfEd-Angular-ngRepeat-Creating-Button-Menu >
                        and wanted to apply < DOM > individual manipulation
                        to the elements generated by < ngRepeat >. I found
                        it's easy with standard DOM referencing but very
                        difficult with "pure" Angular per what I'm trying to do.
                        In my pursuits, I have learned it proper to use 
                        < directives > to manipulate the DOM in Angular. So
                        learning directives might give me the insight I need.

    Refer to file < CustomDirective.html > for code examples. I've mostly
    been working ngClass and working with the examples from the API: 
    < https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngClass >
    I'm going on the notion if any DOM manipulation is used in regular JS, 
    I can do it with directives in Angular.
    
    So far, I've taken my cue's s from the Angular API. It has good examples
    and I'm liking going to the API more and more as I get to know it.
    Kind of as an unspoken rule I try my best to limit myself to my own SelfEds
    and official API's for any material I need to review or relearn. 
    This way I can be faster in the field.
