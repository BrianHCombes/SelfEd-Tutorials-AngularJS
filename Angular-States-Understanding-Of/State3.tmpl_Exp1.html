<h3><span style='color:red;'>This is State 3:</span></h3>
<span style='color:red; font-size:initial;'>This text is from the HTML template 
file called: State3.tmpl_Exp1.html. The <b>templateUrl</b> property is used to 
access this template file and <b>NOT</b> the url property.</span><br><br>
<span style='color:black; font-size:initial;'>&#9658; Up to this point I have 
<b>NOT</b> come across much discussion about the nuances about using the url 
property. But its value is treated as a url fragment or a path parameter because 
it gets a hash mark inserted between the absolute url path and the url part as 
defined in this url-property:value in the code of this config module.<br><br>
&#9658; In State 3, here, there is no url property defined. See 
<span style='color:blue;'><b>Code Block CCC</b></span>. I do know the presence 
of the url property affects browser behavior. When present it can define the 
default view (as in State 1). When present it's remembered as a unique url that 
<b>IS</b> recognized by the back and forward buttons. Also, it appears to be 
treated as a <b>relative url</b> within the confines of ui-router.Without the
url property 
the view (state) will <b>NOT</b> be recognized by the back or forward button 
as is the case with this State. Also, if not present, there's no cursor pointer 
when hovering over it.<br><br> &#9658; Aside from these observations, maybe 
it's useful when evaluating the current state in order to load the correct next 
state.<br><br>Here's a couple of recommended links discussing the hash mark and
