    <span style="color:red;">This text is a view (or state) from within the 
        state you clicked the button from. It's a nested view with it's own 
        unique url as your browser's url bar will show. Click the button back 
        and forth to see the url bar activity go back and forth between the
        default view and the state within a state view.
        <span style="color:blue;"><br><b>NOTE!</b> The state within a state is 
        its own unique state.</span><br><br>
