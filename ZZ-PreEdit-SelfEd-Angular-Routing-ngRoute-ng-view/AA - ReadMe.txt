                        (This is a revisit and update on 12/31/2016 because 
                        I needed to reference this SelfEd while doing another 
                        lesson. See SelfEd Catalyst for the other lesson)

SelfEd Title:           SelfEd-Angular-Routing-ngRoute-ng-view

SelfEd Objective:       To learn Angular Routing

SelfEd Catalyst:        This SelfEd was part of my normal learning process. 
                        I had to return to it on 12/31/2016 because I was 
                        having trouble with a routing example from the book:

                        < AngularJS Up and Running - Ch 10 - page 142 >

                        It turned out to be a really stupid problem (syntax).
                        But it brought me to this lesson and deepened my
                        understanding never-the-less.

Process:

    This is a working routing example. Most of it is self explanatory. 
    But note the url path formats on the templateUrl lines and the folders 
    containing the called upon html files.

    Also note the page links like #red have no name convention relation 
    with the templateUrl path. You can name them independently
