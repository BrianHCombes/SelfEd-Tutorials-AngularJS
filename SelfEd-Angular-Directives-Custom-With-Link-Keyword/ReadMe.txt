SelfEd Title:           SelfEd-Javascript-Functions-Anonymous

SelfEd Objective:       To better understand anonymous functions

SelfEd Catalyst:                

SelfEd References:      http://esbueno.noahstokes.com/post/77292606977/self-executing-anonymous-functions-or-how-to-write 

Process:

    Had a brief moment where I needed to brush up on anonymous functions.
    Found this great Noah Stokes tutorial (listed in above).
    He gets reasonably complex at the end of his tutorial. I plan to write
    some SelfEd code based on his example (hopefully soon). For now, his 
    tutorial is all that's needed.
