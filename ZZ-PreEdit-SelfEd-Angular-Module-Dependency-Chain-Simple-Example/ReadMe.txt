SelfEd Date:        12/25/2016
                    This SeldEd was originally started on 10/03/2016. This is a 
                    revisit because I've circled around MEAN stack technology
                    once and am back to the angular part of MEAN stack.

SelfEd Title:       SelfEd-Angular-Simple-Dependency-Chain.html

SelfEd Objective:   To better understand dependencies, namely $http service
                    dependencies and all the intricacies involved. 

SelfEd Catalyst:    Been working on $http services including promises and 
                    advanced $http features. Refer to Page 90 in the book 
                    < AngularJS Up and Running >. I'm still not fully comfortable
                    with propogating success and error and the chaining of 
                    promises.
