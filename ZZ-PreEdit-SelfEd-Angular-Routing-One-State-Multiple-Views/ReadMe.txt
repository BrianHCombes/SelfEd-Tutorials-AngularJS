                        09/07/2016 (This SelfEd was originally created on
                        this date. This is a revisit and format update.

SelfEd Title:           SelfEd-Angular-Routing-UI-Router-UI-View

SelfEd Objective:       To learn an alternate routing technology other than
                        ngRoute. ngRoute is no longer a part of the core 
                        AngularJS library. 
                        This is due to alternate routing options
                        many developers began using and the AngularJS team 
                        decided to make ngRoute an optional module.

SelfEd Catalyst:        The revisit to this SelfEd is inspired by my 
                        encounters with Chapter 10 in the book:
                        
                                < AngularJS Up and Running >

                        After learning ngRoute (per the book) it offered
                        an alternate, namely  < ui-router >. Until this
                        encounter with Chapter 10, I had mostly been exposed
                        to < ui-router > in other tutorials.

    There's not much to add since the original SelfEd. I'll be adding new
    comments as I fool around with the code as time goes on.

    Notes:
    Netbeans doesn't recognize ui-view so you must prefix with data thus: data-ui-view works.
    See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26077892/ui-view-not-allowed-on-element-at-this-point
