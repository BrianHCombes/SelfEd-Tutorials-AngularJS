This is a tutorial from [**Thomas Greco**](https://www.sitepoint.com/author/tgreco/). His tutorial is [How to Write Modular Code with Angular UI-Router & Named Views](http://www.sitepoint.com/write-modular-code-angular-ui-router-named-views)

I will later use his tutorial as a baseline to develop this SelfEd
