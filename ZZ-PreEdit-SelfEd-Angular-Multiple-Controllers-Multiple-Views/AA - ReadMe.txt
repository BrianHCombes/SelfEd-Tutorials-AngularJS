SelfEd Date: 		12/26/2016
                        Note: This SelfEd was originally started in the first half of Oct 2016.
                        This is a revisit.

SelfEd Title:           SelfEd-Angular-Multiple-Controllers-Multiple-Views
                        (Project folder is < SelfEd-Angular-Multiple-Controllers >

SelfEd Objective:       To better learn Angular controllers

SelfEd Catalyst:        Am studying controller dependencies because of the $http 
                        service dependency used in Chapter 6 titled < Server 
                        Communication Using $http > on page 89, 94, 99, 101 of 
                        book: < AngulaJS Up and Running >.
                        Although this SelfEd is about multiple controllers and
                        multiple views with the given controller dependencies I 
                        will see if there is more depth to controller dependency.

Process:    
        The < MultipleControllersMultipleViews.html > file is the nominal
        place to start.
            
        Have had no problem practicing module dependencies in 
        SelfEd: < SelfEd-Angular-Module-Dependency-Chain-Simple-Example >
        But there are controller dependencies as well of which
        I want to better familiarize myself with. I know there is
        the usual controller dependencies as demonstrated in this
        SelfEd but I will explore if there is more depth to it.
