SelfEd Title:           SelfEd-Angular-API-Directive-ngClass

SelfEd Objective:       To manipulate the example

SelfEd Catalyst:        Had been CSS styling via Angular and
                        wanted more details and when I visited the API, the
                        example was convoluted at best. This just means I still
                        lots of learning to do. I would change the JS file but
                        the program would still work as the original. Maybe it
                        something to do with Plunker I'm not familiar with.
                        So I decided to load it here in Netbeans and see what 
                        happens.

Process:

        I swore this code would not run. It seems an unfamiliar form of 
        Javascript. In fact I just found you don't even need the Javascript
        to make the CSS work. See: < CSS_Exp1.html > where the Javascript is
        commented out.

        For a bare bones example see < CSS_Exp2.html > which has a sole
        example because I stripped everything else away.

        AHA!! The bit about swearing the code would not run. Well, it had to do 
        with the protractor.js file. Turns out it might be a unit testing file. 
        This kind of file is used in the likes of Karma and Jasmine. 
        Karma and Jasmine are discussed in the book:
